# Titanic Dataset
 
## Understanding the Context and Problem Definition
In 1912 the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg resulting in the deaths of majority of its passengers (1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew) which translated a 32% survival rate.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough life boats for the passengers and crew.

Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class since they were given priority on the life boats.

Knowing various features about every single passenger, can our model determine if these passengers named in the dataset survived or not?

Instructions
The Titanic Dataset

The test set doesn't have the label feature, therefore we will use the train set to create the train(80%) and test data(20%) i.e. spliiting further.

Thereafter perform the K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier.

Compute the accuracy (percentage of correct classification).

Report the confusion matrix of the KNN Classifier.

Repeat the steps twice, each time splitting the datasets differently i.e. 70-30, 60-40.Then note the outcomes of your modeling.

Suggest and apply an optimization technique.

Provide further recommendations to improve the classifier.
